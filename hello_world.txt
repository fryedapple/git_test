Hello world! I have begun my journey learning programming! 
I was earlier thinking If I should devote all my energies to just reading and theory, apart from business work.
But now I am going to do this as a fun hobby. Plus it will expand my mind and skillset and allow me to think in more logical ways.
And I do really want to learn coding, it fascinates me. The time that I spend on gaming I can spend it here.
